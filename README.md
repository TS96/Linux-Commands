<h1>Description</h1> 
<p>This is a mock-up of multiple linux commands, written in Java, with room to add a lot more over time. All of the commands are writting in an object-oriented manner which allows you to reuse code across current and future commands</p>
<h2>Current commands written so far:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>ls (FileList)- lists all the files in current directory or specified path with some options to show more info about each file.</li>
	<li>find (Find)- Finds a specified file starting from whichever path entered with some options like "prune" etc.</li>
	<li>echo (Echo)- echos anything you like with some formatting options available</li>
	<li>pwd (WorkingDir)- prints the current working directory</li>
</ul>
